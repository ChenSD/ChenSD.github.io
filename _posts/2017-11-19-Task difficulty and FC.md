# paper 1
* title:  "A parametric manipulation of factors affecting task-induced deactivation in functional neuroimaging." Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience 15(3): 394-408.
* authors: Mckiernan, K. A., et al. (2003).
* Task-induced deactivation (TID) magnitude increased with task difficulty.

# paper 2
* title: Pain Enhances Functional Connectivity of a Brain Network Evoked by Performance of a Cognitive Task
* 实验范式 The attention-demanding cognitive task was a variation of the multi-source interference task (MSIT)
* The results indicate that task difficulty is associated with increased activity of the task-positive network and reduced activity in the task-negative network.

# paper 3
* title: Control of goal-directed and stimulus-driven attention in the brain
* authors: M Corbetta, GL Shulman - Nature reviews neuroscience, 2002
