# BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (BBS)

EIF             | Publication history | Publisher | Frequency | Impact factor
----------------|---------------------|-----------|-----------|--------------
Paul Bloom, Barbara L. Finlay | 1978–present        | Cambridge University Press  | Bimonthly  | 14.2

* 主编简介1：Paul Blöøm是一位加拿大裔美国心理学家，现为耶鲁大学心理学和认知科学的教授。His research explores how children and adults understand the physical and social world, with special focus on language, morality, religion, fiction, and art.
* 主编简介2：Barbara L. Finlay为康奈尔大学（Cornell University）心理学教授,[个人网站](http://people.psych.cornell.edu/~blf2/)。She takes an evolutionary and developmental approach to the structure and function of the vertebrate nervous system, particularly the visual system and the cerebral cortex. What "units" of variation does the brain offer up to natural selection, and how do those units reflect the brain’s evolutionary path?   How are the universal requirements of sensory system design and computation in nervous systems integrated with species-specific adaptations and niches?

## Part 1 Basic Information of BBS

* Scope: The journal publishes "target articles" followed by 10 to 30 or more peer commentaries and the response of the authors of the target article. The journal covers all areas of the biobehavioral and cognitive sciences (psychology, neuroscience, behavioral biology, cognitive science, artificial intelligence, linguistics, philosophy) and articles are judged by four or more referees to be of sufficient importance and interdisciplinary scope to merit Open Peer Commentary.
* Types: Target article and commentaries
    1. Target article can be:
       (i) the report and discussion of **empirical research** that the author judges to have broader scope and implications than might be more appropriately reported in a specialty journal;
      (ii) an unusually significant **theoretical article** that formally models or systematizes a body of research;
      (iii) a novel **interpretation, synthesis, or critique** of existing experimental or theoretical work.
    2. Commentary articles appear by **invitation only**. If a manuscript is judged by BBS referees and editors to be appropriate for Commentary (see Criteria below), it is circulated electronically to a large number of potential commentators selected from the BBS Associateship and the worldwide biobehavioral science community, including individuals recommended by the author. The author should also offer an explicit 500 word rationale for soliciting Commentary, and a list of suggested commentators (complete with e-mail addresses).
* 注意，在WOS中的![分类体系](https://images.webofknowledge.com/images/help/WOS/hs_document_type.html)中，Target article对应Article，Commentary对应Editorial Material。Editorial Material is An article that gives the opinions of a person, group, or organization. Includes editorials, interviews, commentary, and discussions between individual, post-paper discussions, round table symposia, and clinical conferences.

## Part 2 Style and format for target articles

* Target Articles must not exceed 14,000 words (and should ordinarily be considerably shorter); commentaries should not exceed 1,000 words, excluding references.
* Spelling, capitalization, and punctuation should be consistent within each article and commentary and should follow the style recommended in the latest edition of A Manual of Style, The University of Chicago Press.
* Figures should appear in the body of the text, not at the end of the paper, and must be supplied as separate TIFF, EPS, JPEG, or GIF files. However, if your article is accepted, TIFF or EPS format will be requested for publication since printing requires resolutions of at least 1100 dpi.
* Other factors: word counts of each part (abstract short 100/long250, 12000 Main text), 5-10 Key words (in alpha order)
* Good English greatly improves its chances at the refereeing stage.
* References: Bibliographic citations in the text must include the author's last name and the date of publication and may include page references. Complete bibliographic information for each citation should be included in the list of references. Please also include and link to the WWW URL for any paper for which it exists. Examples of correct styles are: Brown (1973); (Brown 1973); Brown 1973; 1978); (Brown 1973; Jones 1976); (Brown & Jones 1978); (Brown et al. 1978). References should be in alphabetical order in the style of the following examples. Do not abbreviate journal titles:
