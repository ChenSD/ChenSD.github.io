# How to Write and Publish a Scientific Paper (Project-Centered Course)

## Week1

### 为什么要发表文章

To share your results to your scientific commnuity. 分享成果给同行并得到反馈，提高自我影响力。
To contribute to the human knowledge!

### 了解期刊和投稿
1. 了解期刊如何运行：peer review system
2. 了解如何评判一共期刊的好坏
3. Submission: 第一要知道期刊的收稿范畴是由主编和编辑的研究领域所决定的，所以必须要了解主编和编辑的研究方向，以确定自己的文章是否对口；第二，查看期刊被引用最多的文章类型，确保自己手稿中也引用了这些文章。因为这样做可以表示你是圈内人士，大家具有共同语言。

### Ethical Guidelines

1. 避免利益冲突
2. 避免学术不端（引用是尤其需要注意的问题）

## Week2

### Know your paper! What is my paper about? So what?

You have to answer the question: So what?
Learn how to organize your answers into a paper properly

1. Is it worthy to write about? What could I contribute to my research filed and community if I write it?
2. Who should I discuss with ?
3. What kind of paper do I want to write?
4. Know compatibility between paper and journal

### How to: the literature review 1/2: find a good literature review

* 我们站在巨人的肩膀上。
* 我们需要了解巨人（前人的研究到了什么水平）
* 也需要知道我们在巨人的肩膀上前进了有多少步，往哪个方向前进的（实证研究？新观点？新方法？新研究背景？）？

### How to: the literature review 2/2: construction of your own literature review

Goals of literature review:
* Identify the knowledge frontier and what needs to be stduied
* Identify the context of your research question/research problem
* Identify key words, varibles linked to your research question/research, and their potential relationships
* Establish the relationships between theorietical frames on one part and empirical considerations on the other

How to search references(papers/handbooks/review):
* Transfer your subject to key words
* Goggle scholar
* Store the references you found and organize them according to your interests

### How to the research design: How to build a research quetion from the gap?

The research quetion should be **the Highlight** of your paper

如何从前人文献中挖研究点？The "gap"  By filling the gap in the literature, you can really contribute to your scientific commnuity.
* Has it already been done? It must have not been done!
* Is it possible to go further in this direction in an original way?

### How to the gap? Coherence of the research design

Here are a few questions that you can ask yourself to ensure your research design is coherent:
1. is my problematic coherent with the literature strand I chose for theoretical anchorage? Introduction
2. is my methodology compatible with the problematic I established? Method
3. do I enrich the comprehension of the literature with the discussion of my results? Results and Discussion

By asking these quetions and solving them, we can clarify our research question:
* clear
* coherent
* concise

## Week3 Writing the paper: things you need to knowledge

### 3.1 The structure of an academic paper

* Title
* Abstract
* Keywords
* Introduction: Literature review, Limits of previous studies, Research question
* Method: Konw what your target journals expect to see in your method
* Results
* Discussion : explain what you found, and how your findings contribute to your scientific commnuity
* Conclusion
* References
* Other: figures/tables/appendix

### 3.2 Preliminary advice on writing an academic paper

* Writing order: write the introduction, conclusion and adstract at last
* Write for your community!
* The first sentence of your introduction is very important!
* Write the abstract and introduction according to the MRCI framwork
  1. M: Motivation - What is the motivation of your topic ? Explain why there is a real gap in the literature ? Why your research question is an interesting one, relevant one or an important one ? Why your research is necessary ? Why no one has done it before ?
  2. R: Results - What are your findings?
  3. C: Contribution - How do your results (theoretical, empirical or methodological) contribute to the ongoing research or previous literature? Empirical involves bringing up new data or highlighting new phenomenon. Methodological would involve a new design method that is better than others or complementary to others.
  4. I : Implications - Are there any implications of your work for future research ?
* The literature review is also **a political act**. By choosing whom you are quoting, you are choosing side in the research community. So treat carefully and make sure you're not omitting any key reference.

### 3.3 How to the bibilography

Master how to use Endnote!

### 3.4 How to the abstract

* Important! Edition in chief generally focus on this part
* The features of an abstract:
   * short length
   * Preface of your article
   * Plan of your article
 * The structure of abstract: MRCI

 * Check by the following questions:
    1. Who are the intended readers?
	2. What did you do?
	3. Why did you do it?
	4. What happened when you did that?
	5. What do your results mean in practice and in theory?
