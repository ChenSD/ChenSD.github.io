# Theory

three generations through which research into new concepts or ideas tend to progress
    1. The first generation question (Is question): Dose X affect or relate to Y? That is: Is there an affect or a phenomenon?
	2. The second generation quetion (When quetion):  Under what (often social) conditions does the effect hold? Or: When, in fact, is there a relation
	between X and Y? These are basically questions designed to determine the boundary conditions of an effect?	   
	3. Third-generation question (How question): What mediates the effect? Or: How can we characterize the psychological process(es) which mediate(s) the phenomennon of interest?
		These are basically quetions of mediation, or process, which we would like to call "How" quetions.
