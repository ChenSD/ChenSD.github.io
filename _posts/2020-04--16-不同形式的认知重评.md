# Detached reappraisal versus positive reappraisal

* 这个分类是以认知重评的方向（积极还是中性）来分
* The most commonly studied reappraisal substrategies are detached reappraisal and positive reappraisal (Shiota & Levenson, 2012), which are frequently used interchangeably (Moser, Krompinger, Dietz, &
Simons, 2009; Paul, Simon, Kniesche, Kathmann, & Endrass, 2013; Thiruchselvam, Blechert, Sheppes, Rydstrom, & Gross, 2011). 
* Detached reappraisal involves reinterpreting emotional stimuli in a detached and unemotional way
* Positive reappraisal does so in a positive way.


# Self- and situation-focused reappraisal

* 这个分类是以认知重评关注的内外倾向来分，跟上一个分类比较类似。有的研究也把两个分类等同视之，即将self-focused reappraisal视为detached reappraisal，将situation-focused reappraisal视为positive reappraisal
* Self-focused reappraisal reinterpret one’s subjective relationship to a stimulus, for example by detaching or distancing oneself from the emotional context (Ayduk and Kross 2008; Davis et al. 2011; Liberman et al. 2002). For example, if I see blood, I will take the perspective of a physician
* Situation-focused reappraisal reinterpret the situational context of an emotionally charged situation in a constructive manner (Ochsner et al. 2002, 2004; Urry 2010). For example, if I see blood, I will think blood represents vitality and health.
